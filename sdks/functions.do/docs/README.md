# Functions.do Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for [Functions.do](https://functions.do), a core primitive of the [.do](https://dotdo.ai) ecosystem that provides strongly-typed AI functions.

## What is Functions.do?

Functions.do transforms unpredictable AI capabilities into reliable, deterministic components for your applications. It provides an elegant, type-safe interface to AI capabilities that seamlessly integrates with your existing codebase.

## The Challenge Functions.do Solves

Integrating AI into production systems presents several challenges:

- **Unpredictability**: AI outputs vary, making testing and maintenance difficult
- **Schema Enforcement**: Ensuring AI outputs conform to expected structures
- **Model Selection**: Choosing the right model for each specific task
- **Prompt Engineering**: Creating effective prompts that produce consistent results
- **Type Safety**: Maintaining strong typing across AI interactions

## Key Features

- **Zero-Boilerplate Integration**: Use AI capabilities with minimal code
- **Type-Safe Interfaces**: Get predictable, structured outputs that match your schemas
- **Multiple Invocation Patterns**: Choose the syntax that fits your coding style
- **Schema Enforcement**: Ensure AI outputs conform to your expected data structures
- **Model Abstraction**: Switch between AI models without changing application code
- **Elegant API Design**: Clean, intuitive interfaces that prioritize developer experience
