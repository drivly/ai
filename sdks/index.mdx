# SDKs

The .do platform provides a suite of SDKs for different domains, each designed to simplify integration with specific platform capabilities:

- [Workflows.do](/docs/sdks/workflows.do) - Elegant business process orchestration
- [APIs.do](/docs/sdks/apis.do) - Unified API gateway
- [Functions.do](/docs/sdks/functions.do) - AI function execution
- [Agents.do](/docs/sdks/agents.do) - Autonomous AI workers
- [Database.do](/docs/sdks/database.do) - Data storage and retrieval
- [Analytics.do](/docs/sdks/analytics.do) - Performance measurement
- [GPT.do](/docs/sdks/gpt.do) - GPT model integration
- [Evals.do](/docs/sdks/evals.do) - Evaluation framework
- [Experiments.do](/docs/sdks/experiments.do) - A/B testing and experimentation
- [LLM.do](/docs/sdks/llm.do) - Language model interface
- [Models.do](/docs/sdks/models.do) - Model management

Each SDK is designed to be lightweight and only depends on `apis.do` as its foundation.
