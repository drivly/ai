# Technical Context

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript/JavaScript as the primary language
- Next.js for web applications and API routes
- pnpm for package management and workspace organization
- React for frontend components
- Node.js for server-side operations
- MongoDB for database storage
- Payload CMS for content management
- Vercel for deployment and hosting
- OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and other AI providers
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Development Environment

- Node.js runtime (v20 or v22 required)
- pnpm package manager (v9 or v10)
- Git for version control
- GitHub for collaboration and CI/CD
- VS Code as the recommended IDE
- ESLint for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- Vitest for testing
- Playwright for end-to-end testing
- Husky for git hooks

## Dependencies

- `ai` - Vercel AI SDK for working with various AI models
- `@payloadcms` - Payload CMS and related packages
- `next-auth` - Authentication for Next.js applications
- `zod` - Schema validation
- `mongodb` - MongoDB client
- `next` - Next.js framework
- `react` - React library
- `tailwindcss` - Utility-first CSS framework
- `typescript` - TypeScript language
- `turbo` - Build system

## Technical Constraints

- Compatibility with various AI model providers
- Edge runtime compatibility for deployment flexibility
- Type safety requirements for all packages
- Performance considerations for AI operations
- Security for handling API keys and user data
- Package size and dependency management

## Infrastructure

- Vercel for hosting and serverless functions
- MongoDB for database storage
- GitHub for source control and CI/CD
- NPM registry for package publishing
- Cloudflare for optional edge deployments
- Sentry for error tracking

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests with Vitest
- Component tests for React components
- End-to-end tests with Playwright
- AI model evaluation with custom evaluation tools
- Benchmarking for performance testing
- Visual regression testing with Chromatic

## Deployment Process

The project uses a continuous integration and deployment approach with semantic versioning:

1. Code changes are pushed to GitHub
2. Automated tests are run via GitHub Actions
3. Pull requests are reviewed and approved
4. Merged changes trigger the release process
5. Semantic versioning determines the next version
6. Packages are published to NPM
7. Documentation is updated
8. Web applications are deployed to Vercel
