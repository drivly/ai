# Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus is on building out and improving the core AI packages and SDKs, with emphasis on creating a cohesive ecosystem of tools that work together. This includes enhancing the AI function generation capabilities, improving the model provider abstraction layer, and developing comprehensive documentation and examples.

## Recent Changes

- Set up memory bank for project documentation and knowledge management
- Ongoing development of AI packages as outlined in the ROADMAP.md
- Implementation of AI function generation with type safety
- Development of model abstractions for various AI providers
- Creation of workflow orchestration tools for AI tasks

## Active Tasks

- [ ] Continue building out the packages outlined in ROADMAP.md
- [ ] Improve documentation for existing packages
- [ ] Enhance type safety and schema validation for AI functions
- [ ] Develop more examples and demos of using the packages
- [ ] Implement testing and evaluation tools for AI models

## Next Steps

1. Review and analyze the existing codebase to understand current implementations
2. Update documentation to reflect current state and usage patterns
3. Implement and test new features according to the roadmap
4. Create example applications showcasing the capabilities of the packages
5. Gather feedback from users and iterate on the packages

## Active Decisions

- How to structure the APIs for maximum developer ergonomics
- Which AI model providers to prioritize for integration
- How to handle versioning and compatibility between packages
- Whether to add additional features based on user feedback
- How to optimize performance for various AI operations

## Open Questions

- What additional AI capabilities should be prioritized?
- How to best support edge runtime deployments?
- What patterns are most effective for AI workflow orchestration?
- How to handle rate limiting and quota management for AI providers?
- What is the best approach for embedding and vector search implementations?

## Current Challenges

- Keeping up with rapidly evolving AI model capabilities
- Ensuring consistent behavior across different AI providers
- Maintaining type safety with dynamic AI function generation
- Optimizing token usage and response handling
- Providing a simple developer experience while supporting complex use cases
