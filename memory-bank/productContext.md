# Product Context

## Problem Statement

Traditional business operations require scaling human labor to grow, creating constraints on scalability and profitability. AI has the potential to enable new business models where services can be delivered without proportionally increasing human labor costs, but developers need accessible tools and frameworks to build these AI-native applications. The Drivly AI project addresses this by providing a comprehensive set of tools and libraries for representing business operations as code with AI capabilities.

- Business operators wanting to automate processes with AI
- Organizations transitioning to AI-native operations
- Startups creating new business models with AI
- Enterprises integrating AI into existing workflows

## User Journeys

1. A developer discovers AI functions and uses them to generate structured objects with a schema, enabling type-safe AI responses for their application
2. A business operator automates customer support with an AI agent, reducing response times and scaling their operation without hiring additional staff
3. A startup uses business-as-code principles to design, launch, and operate their entire business model with minimal human intervention
4. An enterprise integrates AI workflows to connect their existing systems, enhancing productivity across departments
