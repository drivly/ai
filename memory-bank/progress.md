# Progress

## Completed Work

- Initial setup of the monorepo structure with pnpm workspaces
- Development of core AI function generation capabilities
- Implementation of language model abstractions
- Creation of provider router for AI models
- Development of basic workflow orchestration tools
- Setup of the memory bank documentation system

## Work In Progress

- [ ] Enhancing AI function generation with more features
- [ ] Improving documentation for existing packages
- [ ] Implementing testing and evaluation tools
- [ ] Developing more examples and demos
- [ ] Expanding support for additional AI model providers

## Remaining Work

- [ ] Complete implementation of all packages in ROADMAP.md
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation website
- [ ] Develop more sophisticated workflow orchestration tools
- [ ] Build advanced agent capabilities
- [ ] Implement specialized business primitives
- [ ] Create visual design system for AI interfaces
- [ ] Develop end-to-end testing infrastructure

## Current Status

The project is in active development with several core packages already implemented and available. The foundational architecture is in place, and the focus is now on expanding capabilities, improving documentation, and developing more examples to showcase the potential of the system.

## Known Issues

- Documentation still needs significant improvement
- Some edge cases may not be handled properly in AI function generation
- Type safety could be improved in certain areas
- Testing coverage is not yet comprehensive
- Some packages have interdependencies that need to be better managed

## Blockers

- Rapid evolution of AI model capabilities requiring frequent updates
- Complexity of supporting multiple AI providers with different APIs
- Need for more real-world testing and feedback
- Time constraints for implementation of all planned features
