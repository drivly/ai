# Firecrawl Documentation

This file serves as a reference to the Firecrawl documentation maintained in `docs/firecrawl.md`. 

As requested in ticket ENG-476, we are keeping the Firecrawl documentation as a single markdown file without splitting it into multiple files or moving it to the content directory.

The original documentation file is located at `docs/firecrawl.md` and contains all the necessary information about Firecrawl's web scraping, crawling, and data extraction capabilities.
