# Introduction

Better Auth is a framework-agnostic authentication and authorization framework for TypeScript. It provides a comprehensive set of features out of the box and includes a plugin ecosystem that simplifies adding advanced functionalities. Whether you need 2FA, multi-tenancy, multi-session support, or even enterprise features like SSO, it lets you focus on building your application instead of reinventing the wheel.

## [Why Better Auth?](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/introduction\#why-better-auth)

_Authentication in the TypeScript ecosystem has long been a half-solved problem. Other open-source libraries often require a lot of additional code for anything beyond basic authentication features. Rather than just pushing third-party services as the solution, I believe we can do better as a community—hence, Better Auth_

## [Features](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/introduction\#features)

Better Auth aims to be the most comprehensive auth library. It provides a wide range of features out of the box and allows you to extend it with plugins. Here are some of the features:

Framework Agnostic

Support for most popular frameworks

Email & Password

Built-in support for secure email and password authentication

Account & Session Management

Manage user accounts and sessions with ease

Built In Rate Limiter

Built in rate limiter with custom rules

Automatic Database Management

...and much more!
