# Models - AI Model Management

> **Select, configure, and optimize AI models for specific business needs**

## Overview

Models provide a comprehensive framework for selecting, configuring, and optimizing AI models within the .do ecosystem. This system enables organizations to choose the right models for specific tasks, manage model versions, and optimize performance based on business requirements.

## Key Features

- **Model Selection** - Choose the optimal model for each specific task
- **Provider Abstraction** - Reduce vendor lock-in with provider-agnostic interfaces
- **Performance Optimization** - Select models based on benchmark performance
- **Cost Management** - Control spending with explicit cost constraints
- **Capability Matching** - Ensure models have required features for specific tasks

## Core Concepts

### Model Routing

- Dynamic Model Selection
- Capability-Based Routing
- Performance-Based Routing
