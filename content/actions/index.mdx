# Actions

Execute operations that impact external systems from your AI applications, creating real-world effects from your workflows.

## Overview

Actions provide a framework for defining and executing operations that interact with external systems. They enable you to:

- Create standardized interfaces for external operations
- Execute operations with proper validation and error handling
- Compose complex workflows from simple actions
- Track and audit action execution
- Can be used as tools by Agents for interacting with external systems

## Features

- **Input Validation**: Ensure actions receive valid parameters
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully manage and report failures
- **Retry Logic**: Automatically retry failed actions with backoff
- **Audit Logging**: Track who executed what actions and when
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent overloading external systems

## Usage

```typescript
import { defineAction } from 'actions.do'

// Define an email action
const sendEmail = defineAction({
  name: 'sendEmail',
  description: 'Sends an email to a recipient',
  
  // Define the input parameters
  input: {
    to: { type: 'string', format: 'email', required: true },
    subject: { type: 'string', required: true },
    body: { type: 'string', required: true },
    attachments: { type: 'array', items: 'Attachment', optional: true }
  },
  
  // Define the output schema
  output: {
    messageId: { type: 'string' },
    status: { type: 'string', enum: ['sent', 'queued', 'failed'] }
  }
})
```
