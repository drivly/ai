# Getting Started

All of the [`.do` SDKs](/docs/sdks) are installed as dependencies of the [`workflows.do` package](/docs/sdks/workflows.do), so you only need to install one package to get started:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i workflows.do
```

And set your API key in an environment variable:

```env .env
DO_API_KEY=sk_do_...
```

Then you can use any of the packages like:

```ts
import { ai } from 'functions.do'
import { db } from 'database.do'

const ideas = await db.ideas.search('agentic workflows')

const brands = await Promise.all(
  ideas.map(idea => ai.storyBrand({ idea }))
)

console.log(brands)
```
