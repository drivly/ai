# Functions.do

Functions transform inputs into reliable outputs through classical and AI-powered computation.

## code.functions.do / Classical Computation

Leverage traditional computation methods to deliver precise, deterministic outcomes. These functions manage logical workflows, validation routines, and algorithmic tasks.

```javascript
export function calculateTotal(items) {
  return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0)
}
```

## ai.functions.do / Intelligent Structured Outputs

Use advanced AI models to deliver intelligent, structured results. These functions manage reasoning tasks, data enrichment, and decision-making processes, ensuring outcomes are contextually relevant and dynamic.

```javascript
export async function generateSummary(text) {
  return await ai`Summarize the following text in 3 sentences: ${text}`
}

export async function extractEntities(document) {
  return await ai.extract({
    schema: {
      people: 'string[]',
      locations: 'string[]',
      organizations: 'string[]'
    },
    prompt: `Extract entities from this document: ${document}`
  })
}
```

## Business Value

Functions.do enables organizations to:
- Standardize business logic across applications
- Ensure consistent outputs for critical processes
- Combine classical computation with AI capabilities
- Create reusable building blocks for complex workflows
- Measure and optimize function performance against business KPIs
