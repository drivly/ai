# Workflows.do

Create declarative state machines that orchestrate the execution of functions to achieve reliable business processes. Workflows provide a structured way to automate complex operations while maintaining visibility and control.

## Business Process Automation

Workflows enable organizations to:
- Define complex business processes as code
- Ensure consistent execution of critical operations
- Maintain visibility into process status and performance
- Automatically handle errors and exceptions
- Scale operations without proportional complexity

## Key Capabilities

- **Declarative Definition**: Define what should happen, not how it should happen
- **State Management**: Automatically track and manage process state
- **Error Handling**: Built-in retry mechanisms and fallback strategies
- **Conditional Logic**: Dynamic branching based on business rules
- **Observability**: Monitor execution, performance, and business KPIs
- **Auditability**: Track every step for compliance and optimization

## Integration with Functions and Agents

Workflows orchestrate Functions for reliable execution and can be triggered by Agents for autonomous operation, creating a complete business automation ecosystem.
