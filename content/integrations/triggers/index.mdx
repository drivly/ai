# Triggers - Event-Driven Automation

> **Seamless event-driven automation through type-safe trigger definitions**

## Overview

Triggers provide a comprehensive framework for creating and managing event-based automations within the .do ecosystem. This system enables workflows and functions to initiate in response to events from various sources, creating seamless automation across business processes.

## Key Features

- **Unified Event Handling** - Consistent patterns for events from any source
- **Declarative Conditions** - Simple, powerful conditions for trigger activation
- **Reliable Scheduling** - Precise time-based triggers with built-in reliability
- **Seamless Data Mapping** - Transform event data into structured inputs
- **Elegant Error Recovery** - Graceful failure modes with retry capabilities
