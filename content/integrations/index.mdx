- Execute actions in external systems
- Provide unified access to distributed business data
- Serve as tools for Agents and AI Functions

## Features

- **Pre-built Connectors**: Ready-to-use integrations for popular business systems

- **Managed Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions for integration access

```typescript
import { defineIntegration } from 'integrations.do'
