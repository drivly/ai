# [Integrations.do](https://integrations.do) - External System Connectors

> Connect your AI applications to external APIs, services, and data sources

## Overview

Integrations.do provides pre-built connectors to external systems and APIs, allowing your AI applications to seamlessly interact with the tools and services your organization already uses. These integrations enable:

- Authentication and connection to external services
- Data transformation between systems
- Event synchronization
- Webhook handling
- Service discovery

## Features

- **Pre-built Connectors**: Ready-to-use integrations for popular business systems
- **Custom Connectors**: Build your own integrations for proprietary systems
- **Authentication Management**: Secure connections with OAuth, API keys, and other methods
- **Managed Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions for integration access
- **Tool Capabilities**: Integrations can be used as tools by AI Agents and Humans

## Integrations as Tools

Integrations.do connectors can be used as tools by both AI Agents and human users, creating a unified interface for interacting with external systems:

### For AI Agents

AI Agents can use integrations as tools to access external data and services:

```typescript
// Example of an agent using integrations as tools
const salesAgent = Agent({
  name: 'SalesAssistant',
  tools: [
    // Integrations available as tools
    api.salesforce,
    api.hubspot,
    api.slack,
    api.gmail,
  ],
})

// The agent can use these integrations to accomplish tasks
const result = await salesAgent.handle({
  task: 'Update our CRM with the latest customer information and notify the sales team',
  context: { customer: customerData },
})
```

### For Humans

The same integrations can be accessed by human users through standardized interfaces:

```typescript
// A human using the same integration
const contacts = await api.salesforce.getContacts({
  filters: { lastModified: { $gt: '2023-01-01' } },
})
```

This shared toolset approach ensures that both AI systems and human operators have consistent access to external systems, enabling seamless collaboration and handoffs between automated and manual processes.

## Usage

```typescript
import { defineIntegration } from 'integrations.do'

// Define a Salesforce integration
const salesforce = defineIntegration({
  name: 'salesforce',
  description: 'Connect to Salesforce CRM',

  // Authentication configuration
  auth: {
    type: 'oauth2',
    scopes: ['api', 'refresh_token'],
  },

  // Define available operations
  operations: {
    getAccounts: {
      description: 'Retrieve accounts matching criteria',
      input: {
        filters: { type: 'object', optional: true },
      },
      output: { type: 'array', items: 'Account' },
    },
    createContact: {
      description: 'Create a new contact',
      input: {
        firstName: { type: 'string' },
        lastName: { type: 'string' },
        email: { type: 'string', format: 'email' },
      },
      output: { type: 'object', properties: { id: 'string' } },
    },
  },
})
```
