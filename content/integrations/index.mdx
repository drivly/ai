# Integrations - External System Connectors

> **Connect AI applications to external APIs, services, and data sources**

## Overview

Integrations provide a comprehensive framework for connecting AI applications to external systems and services within the .do ecosystem. This system enables organizations to seamlessly interact with the tools and services they already use, extending the capabilities of AI functions, workflows, and agents.

## Key Features

- **Pre-built Connectors** - Ready-to-use integrations for popular business systems
- **Custom Connector Development** - Tools to build integrations for proprietary systems
- **Authentication Management** - Secure connections with OAuth, API keys, and other methods
- **Access Control** - Fine-grained permissions for integration access
- **Unified Interface** - Consistent patterns for interacting with diverse external systems

## Core Concepts

### Integration Structure

- Connector Definition
- Authentication Configuration
- Operation Specifications
- Input/Output Schemas
