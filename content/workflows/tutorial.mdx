# Building AI-Powered Workflows: Book Creation Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the workflows.do SDK to create a complex, multi-step workflow for book creation. You'll learn how to:

1. Define a main workflow function that orchestrates multiple steps
2. Create AI function schemas for different stages of the process
3. Integrate with external APIs and databases
4. Process tasks in parallel for efficiency
5. Handle complex data flows between workflow steps

## Getting Started

First, install the workflows.do SDK:

```bash
npm install workflows.do
# or
yarn add workflows.do
# or
pnpm add workflows.do
```

## Basic Workflow Structure

Let's start with a simple version of our book creation workflow to understand the basic structure:

```typescript
import { AI } from 'workflows.do'

export const ai = AI({
  // Main workflow function
  writeBook: async (args, { ai, db, api }) => {
    // Create book proposal
    const proposal = await ai.createBookProposal(args)

    // Generate table of contents
    const toc = await ai.createTableOfContents({ proposal })

    // Save to database and return results
    const { url } = await db.books.create({
      title: proposal.title,
      summary: proposal.summary,
      toc,
    })

    return {
      proposal,
      tableOfContents: toc,
      url,
    }
  },

  // Simple function implementations
  createBookProposal: async (args) => {
    // In a real implementation, this would call an AI model
    return {
      title: `The Complete Guide to ${args.topic}`,
      subtitle: `Everything You Need to Know About ${args.topic}`,
      author: args.author || 'Anonymous',
      summary: `A comprehensive guide covering all aspects of ${args.topic}.`,
    }
  },

  createTableOfContents: async ({ proposal }) => {
    // In a real implementation, this would call an AI model
    return {
      introduction: `Introduction to ${proposal.title}`,
      chapters: [
        { title: 'Getting Started', summary: 'An introduction to the basics' },
        { title: 'Core Concepts', summary: 'Understanding the fundamental concepts' },
        { title: 'Advanced Techniques', summary: 'Taking your skills to the next level' },
      ],
      conclusion: 'Final thoughts and next steps',
    }
  },
})
```

This simple example demonstrates the basic structure of a workflow:

1. A main function (`writeBook`) that orchestrates the workflow
2. Helper functions that perform specific tasks (`createBookProposal`, `createTableOfContents`)
3. The context object (`{ ai, db, api }`) that provides access to AI functions, database, and external APIs

## Adding Function Schemas

As your workflow grows in complexity, it's helpful to define schemas for your AI functions. This provides better type safety and documentation:

```typescript
import { AI } from 'workflows.do'

export const ai = AI({
  // Main workflow function
  writeBook: async (args, { ai, db, api }) => {
    // Create book proposal with provided args
    const proposal = await ai.createBookProposal(args)

    // Generate table of contents based on proposal
    const toc = await ai.createTableOfContents({ proposal })

    // Save to database and return results
    const { url } = await db.books.create({
      title: proposal.title,
      summary: proposal.summary,
      toc,
    })

    return {
      proposal,
      tableOfContents: toc,
      url,
    }
  },

  // Book Proposal schema
  createBookProposal: {
    title: 'proposed title of the book',
    subtitle: 'proposed subtitle of the book',
    author: 'name of the author',
    targetAudience: ['primary audience segments for the book'],
    marketAnalysis: 'analysis of the current market for this type of book',
    uniqueSellingPoints: ['what makes this book different and valuable'],
    summary: 'one paragraph summary of the book concept',
  },

  // Table of Contents schema
  createTableOfContents: {
    bookTitle: 'title of the book',
    introduction: 'brief description of the introduction',
    chapters: [
      {
        title: 'chapter title',
        summary: 'brief summary of the chapter content',
        sections: [
          {
            title: 'section title',
            summary: 'brief description of the section content',
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
    conclusion: 'brief description of the conclusion',
  },
})
```

When you provide a schema object instead of a function, the workflows.do SDK automatically creates an AI function that follows the schema. This approach:

1. Provides clear documentation of expected inputs and outputs
2. Enables automatic type checking and validation
3. Makes your code more maintainable and self-documenting

## Building a Complete Book Creation Workflow

Now let's expand our workflow to include all the steps needed for a complete book creation process:

```typescript
import { AI } from 'workflows.do'

export const ai = AI({
  writeBook: async (args, { ai, db, api }) => {
    // Step 1: Create book proposal with provided args
    const proposal = await ai.createBookProposal(args)

    // Step 2: Generate table of contents based on proposal
    const toc = await ai.createTableOfContents({ proposal })

    // Step 3: Create detailed outlines for each chapter
    const chapterOutlines = await Promise.all(
      toc.chapters.map(async (chapter, idx) => {
        return ai.createChapterOutline({
          bookTitle: proposal.title,
          chapterNumber: (idx + 1).toString(),
          chapterTitle: chapter.title,
        })
      }),
    )

    // Step 4: Write all sections for each chapter
    const completedChapters = await Promise.all(
      chapterOutlines.map(async (outline, idx) => {
        const chapterNumber = idx + 1

        // Write each section in parallel for efficiency
        const sections = await Promise.all(
          outline.sections.map(async (section) => {
            return ai.writeSection({
              bookTitle: proposal.title,
              chapterNumber: chapterNumber.toString(),
              chapterTitle: outline.chapterTitle,
              sectionTitle: section.title,
            })
          }),
        )

        return {
          chapterNumber,
          chapterTitle: outline.chapterTitle,
          sections,
        }
      }),
    )

    // Step 5: Review each chapter for quality and consistency
    const chapterReviews = await Promise.all(
      completedChapters.map(async (chapter) => {
        return ai.reviewChapter({
          bookTitle: proposal.title,
          chapterNumber: chapter.chapterNumber.toString(),
          chapterTitle: chapter.chapterTitle,
        })
      }),
    )

    // Step 6: Perform comprehensive book review
    const bookReview = await ai.reviewBook({ bookTitle: proposal.title })

    // Step 7: Edit book based on review feedback
    const bookEdits = await ai.editBook({ bookTitle: proposal.title })

    // Step 8: Prepare final materials for publication
    const book = await ai.prepareForPublication({ bookTitle: proposal.title })

    // Step 9: Save book to database
    const { url } = await db.books.create({
      title: proposal.title,
      summary: proposal.summary,
      toc,
      chapterOutlines,
      completedChapters,
      chapterReviews,
      bookReview,
      bookEdits,
      publicationPrep: book,
    })

    // Notify team via Slack
    await api.slack.postMessage({
      channel: '#books',
      content: {
        title: proposal.title,
        message: 'Book ready for review ðŸš€',
        url,
      },
    })

    // Step 10: Publish book to external platform
    const publishedBook = await api.amazon.kindle.publish({ book })

    // Notify team of successful publication
    await api.slack.postMessage({
      channel: '#books',
      content: {
        title: proposal.title,
        message: 'Book published ðŸŽ‰',
        url: publishedBook.url,
      },
    })

    // Return complete book package with all components
    return {
      proposal,

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

This comprehensive example demonstrates several key concepts of the workflows.do SDK:

### 1. Workflow Orchestration

The main `writeBook` function orchestrates the entire workflow, calling various AI functions in sequence and managing the flow of data between them.

### 2. Parallel Processing

The workflow uses `Promise.all` to process multiple chapters and sections in parallel, significantly improving efficiency:

```typescript
const chapterOutlines = await Promise.all(
  toc.chapters.map(async (chapter, idx) => {
    return ai.createChapterOutline({
      bookTitle: proposal.title,
      chapterNumber: (idx + 1).toString(),
      chapterTitle: chapter.title,
    })
  }),
)
```

### 3. External API Integration

The workflow integrates with external APIs for notifications and publishing:

```typescript
await api.slack.postMessage({
  channel: '#books',
  content: {
    title: proposal.title,
    message: 'Book ready for review ðŸš€',
    url,
  },
})

const publishedBook = await api.amazon.kindle.publish({ book })
```

### 4. Database Integration

The workflow saves data to a database for persistence:

```typescript
const { url } = await db.books.create({
  title: proposal.title,
  summary: proposal.summary,
  toc,
  chapterOutlines,
  completedChapters,
  // ...
})
```

### 5. Schema-Based AI Functions

The workflow uses schema-based AI functions for clear documentation and type safety:

```typescript
createBookProposal: {
  title: 'proposed title of the book',
  subtitle: 'proposed subtitle of the book',
  author: 'name of the author',
  // ...
}
```

## Customizing for Your Use Case

You can adapt this workflow pattern for many different use cases:

1. **Content Creation**: Generate blog posts, articles, or marketing materials
2. **Research**: Conduct comprehensive research on a topic with multiple stages
3. **Product Development**: Guide the development process from ideation to launch
4. **Customer Onboarding**: Create personalized onboarding experiences
5. **Data Analysis**: Process and analyze data with multiple transformation steps

## Best Practices

When building complex workflows with the workflows.do SDK:

1. **Break down the process**: Divide your workflow into clear, logical steps
2. **Use schemas for clarity**: Define schemas for your AI functions to provide clear documentation
3. **Process in parallel when possible**: Use `Promise.all` for tasks that can be done simultaneously
4. **Handle errors gracefully**: Add error handling for robust workflows
5. **Save intermediate results**: Store important data in your database at key points
6. **Provide clear progress updates**: Use external APIs like Slack to notify stakeholders of progress

## Conclusion

The workflows.do SDK provides a powerful framework for creating complex, AI-powered workflows. By combining AI functions, database integration, and external APIs, you can build sophisticated processes that automate complex tasks and deliver consistent results.

This book creation example demonstrates how to structure a multi-step workflow, but the same patterns can be applied to virtually any business process that can benefit from AI automation.
