```typescript

export default AI({
  onUserSignup: async ({ ai, api, db, event }) => {
    const { name, email, company } = event

    // Enrich content details with lookup from external data sources
    const enrichedContact = await api.apollo.search({ name, email, company })
    const socialProfiles = await api.peopleDataLabs.findSocialProfiles({ name, email, company })
    const githubProfile = socialProfiles.github ? await api.github.profile({ name, email, company, profile: socialProfiles.github }) : undefined

    // Using the enriched contact details, do deep research on the company and personal background
    const companyProfile = await ai.researchCompany({ company })
    const personalProfile = await ai.researchPersonalBackground({ name, email, enrichedContact })
    const socialActivity = await ai.researchSocialActivity({ name, email, enrichedContact, socialProfiles })
    const githubActivity = githubProfile ? await ai.summarizeGithubActivity({ name, email, enrichedContact, githubProfile }) : undefined

    // Schedule a highly personalized sequence of emails to optimize onboarding and activation
    const emailSequence = await ai.personalizeEmailSequence({ name, email, company, personalProfile, socialActivity, companyProfile, githubActivity })
    await api.scheduleEmails({ emailSequence })

    // Summarize everything, save to the database, and post to Slack
    const details = { enrichedContact, socialProfiles, githubProfile, companyProfile, personalProfile, socialActivity, githubActivity, emailSequence }
    const summary = await ai.summarizeContent({ length: '3 sentences', name, email, company, ...details })
    const { url } = await db.users.create({ name, email, company, summary, ...details })
    await api.slack.postMessage({ channel: '#signups', content: { name, email, company, summary, url } })
