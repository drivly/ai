// Create a customer support agent
export const supportAgent = new Agent({
  name: 'customer-support',
  instructions: 'You are a helpful customer support specialist. ' + 'You assist customers with product questions and technical issues.',
  model: 'openai/gpt-4.5',
})

// Use the agent to handle a customer inquiry
const response = await supportAgent.handle({
  customerId: 'cus_12345',
  message: "I'm having trouble connecting my device to WiFi",
  context: {
    recentPurchases: [{ id: 'prod_789', name: 'Smart Hub' }],
