# [Agents.do](https://agents.do) - Autonomous Digital Workers

> Create, deploy, and manage autonomous digital workers that combine functions and workflows

## Overview

Agents.do provides a framework for building autonomous AI systems that can perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with users and other systems. These digital workers can handle routine operations, adapt to changing conditions, and collaborate with humans.

## Features

- **Specialized Capabilities**: Create agents for specific business functions
- **Autonomous Decision Making**: Agents can make decisions within defined parameters
- **Knowledge Integration**: Incorporate domain knowledge and business rules
- **Continuous Learning**: Improve performance through feedback and experience
- **Multi-agent Collaboration**: Coordinate teams of specialized agents
- **Tool Usage**: Agents can use Functions, Workflows, and Integrations as tools

## Using Functions and Workflows as Tools

A powerful capability of Agents.do is the ability to use Functions and Workflows as tools. This creates a composable architecture where agents can leverage specialized capabilities to accomplish complex tasks.

### Functions as Tools

Agents can use any of the four function types as tools:

1. **Generation Functions**: For creating content or structured data
2. **Code Functions**: For deterministic operations and calculations
3. **Agentic Functions**: For delegating subtasks to specialized agents
4. **Human Functions**: For incorporating human judgment and expertise

```typescript
// Example of an agent using functions as tools
const researchAgent = Agent({
  name: 'ResearchAssistant',
  tools: [
    ai.searchWeb,                // Generation function
    ai.analyzeData,              // Code function
    ai.delegateToSpecialist,     // Agentic function
    ai.requestHumanVerification  // Human function
  ]
})
```

### Workflows as Tools

Agents can also use entire workflows as tools, enabling them to trigger complex business processes:

```typescript
// Example of an agent using workflows as tools
const customerSupportAgent = Agent({
  name: 'SupportBot',
  tools: [
    // Workflows available as tools
    ai.escalationWorkflow,
    ai.refundProcessWorkflow,
    ai.knowledgeBaseUpdateWorkflow
  ]
})

// The agent can decide when to trigger a workflow
const response = await customerSupportAgent.handle({
  message: "I never received my order #12345",
  context: { customer: customerData }
})
```

### Human Access to Tools

Importantly, the same Functions and Workflows that are available to AI Agents can also be accessed by human users through interfaces like:

- Web applications
- Chat interfaces
- API endpoints
- Command-line tools

This creates a unified toolset that both AI and human workers can leverage, enabling seamless collaboration and handoffs between automated and human-driven processes.

## Usage

```typescript
import { Agent } from 'agents.do'

// Create a customer support agent
export const supportAgent = new Agent({
  name: 'customer-support',
  instructions: 'You are a helpful customer support specialist. ' + 'You assist customers with product questions and technical issues.',
  model: 'openai/gpt-4.5',
})

// Use the agent to handle a customer inquiry
const response = await supportAgent.handle({
  customerId: 'cus_12345',
  message: "I'm having trouble connecting my device to WiFi",
  context: {
    recentPurchases: [{ id: 'prod_789', name: 'Smart Hub' }],
  },
})
```
