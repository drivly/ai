# Events

Events are a critical part of the observability stack, providing a record of all activities and state changes within the system. They serve as the foundation for monitoring, debugging, and analyzing system behavior.

## Overview

The Events collection captures all significant occurrences within the platform, including:

- User actions
- System operations
- State transitions
- Integration events
- Scheduled tasks
- Error conditions

Each event is timestamped and contains contextual information about what happened, where it happened, and relevant metadata.

## Event Structure

Events follow a consistent structure:

```typescript
interface Event {
  id: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  type: string;
  source: string;
  subject?: string;
  data: Record<string, any>;
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
}
```

- **id**: Unique identifier for the event
- **timestamp**: When the event occurred
- **type**: Classification of the event (e.g., "user.login", "workflow.completed")
- **source**: The component or service that generated the event
- **subject**: Optional identifier for the entity the event relates to
- **data**: Event-specific information
- **metadata**: Additional contextual information

## Event Types

Events are categorized into several types:

### System Events

System events record platform operations, deployments, and infrastructure changes.

### User Events

User events track interactions with the platform, including authentication, resource creation, and configuration changes.

### Resource Events

Resource events document the lifecycle of resources within the system, such as creation, modification, and deletion.

### Integration Events

Integration events capture interactions with external systems and services.

## Working with Events

### Querying Events

Events can be queried using various filters:

```typescript
// Example: Query events by type and time range
const loginEvents = await Events.find({
  type: 'user.login',
  timestamp: {
    $gte: new Date('2023-01-01'),
    $lte: new Date('2023-01-31')
  }
});
```

### Event Subscriptions

You can subscribe to specific event types to receive notifications:

```typescript
// Example: Subscribe to workflow completion events
Events.subscribe('workflow.completed', (event) => {
  console.log(`Workflow ${event.subject} completed`);
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Consistent Naming**: Use a hierarchical naming convention for event types (e.g., "category.action")
2. **Relevant Data**: Include all relevant information in the event data, but avoid excessive detail
3. **Correlation**: Use correlation IDs to link related events across services
4. **Retention Policy**: Implement appropriate retention policies based on event importance

## Integration with Other Observability Tools

Events integrate with other observability components:

- **Logs**: Events often generate corresponding log entries
- **Metrics**: Event counts and timing can be aggregated into metrics
- **Traces**: Events can be linked to distributed traces
- **Alerts**: Event patterns can trigger alerts

## API Reference

### List Events

```typescript
GET /api/events
```

Query parameters:
- `type`: Filter by event type
- `source`: Filter by event source
- `from`: Start timestamp
- `to`: End timestamp
- `limit`: Maximum number of events to return

### Get Event by ID

```typescript
GET /api/events/:id
```

### Create Custom Event

```typescript
POST /api/events
```

Request body:
```json
{
  "type": "custom.event",
  "source": "my-application",
  "subject": "resource-123",
  "data": {
    "key": "value"
  }
}
```
