AI is getting extremely good at skills like math & code, because the outputs are verifiable. By representing your [Business-as-Code](/docs/manifesto), you can leverage the power of AI to automate, optimize, and scale your business processes.

## AI

[Workflows](/docs/workflows) let you define business processes as clean & simple code. [Functions](/docs/functions) can also execute code, use AI to generate structured data, or assign tasks to be performed by humans workers or autonomous [Agents](/docs/agents). [Services](/docs/services) enable Workflows and Functions to be delivered for payment

  <Cards.Card title='Agents.do' href='/docs/agents' />
  <Cards.Card title='Services.do' href='/docs/services' />
</Cards>

## Business

[Goals](/docs/business/goals) are the strategic business objectives you want to achieve, and [KPIs](/docs/business/kpis) allow you to measure progress towards achieving them. [Experiments](/docs/experiments) allow you to rapidly iterate and improve your business processes, while [Projects](/docs/business/projects) help you [Plan](/docs/business/plans) how to get there. [Tasks](/docs/business/tasks) are the day-to-day work delivered by humans and agents.

## Data

[Nouns](/docs/data/nouns) are the categories or types of things in your system, [Verbs](/docs/data/verbs) are the actions that can be performed, [Actions](/docs/data/actions) are the subject-predicate-object relationships, [Resources](/docs/data/resources) are the instances of nouns in your system, and [Integrations](/docs/events/integrations) are the connections between your system and external systems.

</Cards>

## Experiments

[Experiments](/docs/experiments) provides a powerful framework for testing hypotheses, measuring outcomes, and iteratively improving your AI applications. It enables you to run controlled experiments to validate ideas, optimize performance, and make data-driven decisions. [Datasets](/docs/experiments/datasets) are the inputs to your experiments, [Evals](/docs/experiments/evals) are the outputs, and [Benchmarks](/docs/experiments/benchmarks) are the metrics used to measure success.

  {/* <Cards.Card title='Prompts.do' href='/docs/experiments/prompts' /> */}
</Cards>

## Integrations

[Integrations](/docs/events/integrations) provides a framework for connecting your system with external services and APIs. [Triggers](/docs/events/triggers) are the events that initiate workflows, [Searches](/docs/events/searches) are the queries that retrieve data, and [Actions](/docs/events/actions) are the actions that perform tasks.

  <Cards.Card title='Actions.do' href='/docs/events/actions' />
</Cards>

## Models

[Models](/docs/experiments/models) are the AI models used to generate responses to prompts. [LLM](/docs/experiments/llm) is the low-level model used to generate responses, while [GPT](/docs/experiments/gpt) is the high-level model used to generate responses.
