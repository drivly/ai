# AI Primitives Platform

> **Define, execute, and iterate on business processes as clean & simple code**

## Overview

The AI Primitives platform provides a comprehensive framework for building enterprise-grade AI applications through composable building blocks. This platform enables organizations to create powerful AI solutions that are simple enough for non-technical business people to understand while providing the flexibility and power that technical teams need.

## Core Primitives

### Workflows

Business process orchestration through declarative state machines that coordinate multiple functions and agents. Workflows enable you to define complex business processes as clean, readable code that can be executed, monitored, and optimized.

### Functions

Strongly-typed AI operations that transform the unpredictable nature of AI into reliable, structured outputs. Functions provide a clean interface for specific AI tasks with predictable results that integrate seamlessly with your business systems.

### Agents

Autonomous digital workers that combine functions and workflows to accomplish complex tasks. Agents can work independently or collaboratively to solve problems, make decisions, and execute business processes with minimal human intervention.

## Platform Components

### APIs

Unified API gateway that provides consistent access to all platform services. The API layer ensures seamless integration between components and with external systems.

### Database

AI-enriched data storage that provides structured information management with intelligent capabilities. The database component enables efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of business data.

### Events

Event-driven architecture that enables real-time responsiveness to business triggers. The events system includes triggers for workflow initiation, searches for context-aware data retrieval, and actions for external world interactions.

## Business Applications

### Business

Business process management tools including goals, plans, tasks, projects, and KPIs. These components enable organizations to align AI capabilities with strategic objectives.

### Data

Data management capabilities including analytics, databases, events, nouns, resources, and verbs. These components provide the foundation for AI-driven insights and decision-making.

### Experiments

Experimentation framework including analytics, benchmarks, datasets, evaluations, and models. These components enable continuous improvement and optimization of AI solutions.

## Integration Capabilities

### Integrations

Connectors for external systems and APIs, including triggers for event detection, searches for data retrieval, and actions for system operations. These components enable seamless interaction with your existing technology ecosystem.

### Observability

Monitoring and management tools for visibility into AI system performance, including logging, debugging, and analytics. These components ensure reliable operation and continuous improvement of AI solutions.
