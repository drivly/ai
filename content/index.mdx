# `.do` Business-as-Code

AI is getting extremely good at skills like math & code, because the outputs are verifiable. By representing your [Business-as-Code](/docs/manifesto), you can leverage the power of AI to automate, optimize, and scale your business processes.

## AI

[Workflows](/docs/workflows) let you define business processes as clean & simple code. [Functions](/docs/functions) can also execute code, use AI to generate structured data, or assign tasks to be performed by humans workers or autonomous [Agents](/docs/agents).

  <Cards.Card title='Functions.do' href='/docs/functions' />
  <Cards.Card title='Agents.do' href='/docs/agents' />
</Cards>



## Business

[Goals](/docs/business/goals) are the strategic business objectives you want to achieve, and [KPIs](/docs/business/kpis) allow you to measure progress towards achieving them. [Experiments](/docs/experiments) allow you to rapidly iterate and improve your business processes, while [Projects](/docs/business/projects) help you [Plan](/docs/business/plans) how to get there. [Tasks](/docs/business/tasks) are the day-to-day work delivered by humans and agents.

## Data

[Nouns](/docs/data/nouns) are the categories or types of things in your system, [Verbs](/docs/data/verbs) are the actions that can be performed, [Actions](/docs/data/actions) are the subject-predicate-object relationships, [Resources](/docs/data/resources) are the instances of nouns in your system, and [Integrations](/docs/events/integrations) are the connections between your system and external systems.
