# AGI

Build sophisticated autonomous systems that can reason, plan, and adapt to tackle complex problems.

## Overview

AGI provides a framework for creating advanced autonomous systems that can handle complex tasks. It enables you to:

- Orchestrate multiple specialized AI systems
- Create autonomous agents with specific capabilities
- Establish collaboration between AI systems
- Design systems that improve through experience

## Features

- **Multi-agent Systems**: Coordinate teams of specialized agents
- **Reasoning Frameworks**: Enable complex problem-solving
- **Planning Capabilities**: Develop and execute multi-step plans
- **Autonomous Decision Making**: Make decisions with minimal human input
- **Knowledge Integration**: Combine domain expertise across systems

## Usage

```typescript
import { defineAGISystem } from 'agi.do'
import { Agent } from 'agents.do'

// Define specialized agents
export const marketResearcher = new Agent({
  name: 'market-researcher',
  instructions: 'You analyze market data and identify trends',
  model: 'openai/gpt-4.5',
})

export const productDesigner = new Agent({
  name: 'product-designer',
  instructions: 'You design products based on market requirements',
  model: 'openai/gpt-4.5',
})

// Define an AGI system for product development
const productDevelopmentSystem = defineAGISystem({
  name: 'ProductDevelopment',
  description: 'Autonomous system for managing product development',
  agents: [marketResearcher, productDesigner],
  workflows: {
    ideateProduct: 'onProductIdeation',
  },
})
```
