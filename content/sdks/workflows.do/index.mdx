# workflows.do

## Setup

All of the [`.do` SDKs](/docs/sdks) are installed as dependencies of the [`workflows.do` package](/docs/sdks/workflows.do), so you only need to install one package to get started:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i workflows.do
```

Then [get your API key](https://apis.do/console) and set it in an environment variable:

```env .env
DO_API_KEY=sk_do_*****************************
```
