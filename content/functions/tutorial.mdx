# Functions.do SDK Tutorial

This tutorial will guide you through using the functions.do SDK to create and use AI functions in your applications. The functions.do SDK provides a clean separation between AI capabilities and application code through strongly-typed interfaces that hide model complexities.

## Installation

First, install the functions.do SDK using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install functions.do
# or
yarn add functions.do
# or
pnpm add functions.do
```

## API Overview

The functions.do SDK exports two main components:

- `ai`: A flexible proxy for invoking AI functions with various patterns
- `AI`: A function for defining schemas and creating custom AI functions

Let's explore how to use each of these components with practical examples.

## Using the `ai` Proxy

The `ai` export is a versatile proxy that supports multiple invocation patterns, making it ideal for rapid prototyping and development.

### Tagged Template Literals

You can use the `ai` proxy with tagged template literals for simple, natural language interactions:

```typescript
import { ai } from 'functions.do'

// Basic usage
const result = await ai`Summarize this article: ${articleText}`

// With configuration
const configuredResult = await ai({ model: 'grok-3' })`Translate this to French: ${text}`
```

### Function Invocation

The `ai` proxy also supports function-style invocation for more structured interactions:

```typescript
import { ai } from 'functions.do'

// Simple function call without schema
const storyBrand = await ai.storyBrand({ company: 'Vercel' })

// Function call with schema (structured output)
const leanCanvas = await ai.leanCanvas(
  { company: 'Cloudflare' },
  {
    productName: 'name of the product or service',
    problem: ['top 3 problems the product solves'],
    solution: ['top 3 solutions the product offers'],
    uniqueValueProposition: 'clear message that states the benefit of your product',
    unfairAdvantage: 'something that cannot be easily copied or bought',
    customerSegments: ['list of target customer segments'],
    keyMetrics: ['list of key numbers that tell you how your business is doing'],
    channels: ['path to customers'],
    costStructure: ['list of operational costs'],
    revenueStreams: ['list of revenue sources'],
    recommendations: ['list of recommendations based on the analysis'],
  },
)

// Function call with schema and AI configuration
const blogTitles = await ai.listBlogPostTitles(
  { topic: 'the future of work post-API' }, 
  ['list SEO-optimized titles'], 
  { model: 'gpt-4.5' }
)
```

## Using the `AI` Function

The `AI` function allows you to define custom AI functions with specific schemas. This approach provides type safety and structured outputs for your AI functions.

### Basic Schema Definition

Here's a simple example of defining a custom AI function with a schema:

```typescript
import { AI } from 'functions.do'

const ai = AI({
  leanCanvas: {
    productName: 'name of the product or service',
    problem: ['top 3 problems the product solves'],
    solution: ['top 3 solutions the product offers'],
    uniqueValueProposition: 'clear message that states the benefit of your product',
    unfairAdvantage: 'something that cannot be easily copied or bought',
    customerSegments: ['list of target customer segments'],
    keyMetrics: ['list of key numbers that tell you how your business is doing'],
    channels: ['path to customers'],
    costStructure: ['list of operational costs'],
    revenueStreams: ['list of revenue sources'],
    recommendations: ['list of recommendations based on the analysis'],
  },
})

// Using the defined function
const results = await ai.leanCanvas({ domain: 'aws.amazon.com' })
```

### Complex Schema Definition

You can define more complex schemas with nested objects and arrays:

```typescript
import { AI } from 'functions.do'

const ai = AI({
  competitiveLandscape: {
    industry: 'What industry is the startup in?',
    industryMaturity: 'Assessment of industry maturity stage',
    industryTrends: ['Key trends shaping the industry'],
    marketSize: 'Estimated total market size and growth rate',
    marketSegmentation: ['Key market segments and their characteristics'],
    directCompetitors: [
      {
        name: 'Competitor name',
        description: 'Brief description of the competitor',
        founded: 'Year founded',
        funding: 'Funding status and amount if known',
        marketShare: 'Estimated market share',
        targetCustomers: 'Who they target',
        valueProposition: 'Their core value proposition',
        productOffering: 'Overview of their product/service offering',
        pricing: 'Pricing strategy and model',
        strengths: ['Key strengths'],
        weaknesses: ['Key weaknesses'],
        recentDevelopments: ['Recent developments or pivots'],
        growthStrategy: 'Their apparent growth strategy',
        customerSentiment: 'Assessment of customer sentiment',
      },
    ],
    indirectCompetitors: [
      {
        name: 'Competitor name',
        description: 'Brief description of the competitor',
        relevance: 'How they compete indirectly',
        threat: 'Level of threat they pose',
        potentialResponse: 'How they might respond to your entry',
      },
    ],
    competitiveIntensity: 'Assessment of overall competitive intensity',
    barrierToEntry: 'Assessment of barriers to entry in this market',
    supplierPower: 'Assessment of supplier power in this market',
    buyerPower: 'Assessment of buyer power in this market',
    substituteThreat: 'Assessment of threat of substitutes',
    marketGaps: ['Identified gaps in the market'],
    blueOceanOpportunities: ['Potential blue ocean opportunities'],
    differentiationStrategy: 'How to differentiate from competitors',
    competitiveAdvantage: 'Potential sustainable competitive advantage',
    marketEntryStrategy: 'Recommended strategy for entering the market',
    defensibilityAssessment: 'Assessment of how defensible your position would be',
    competitiveResponsePrediction: 'Prediction of how competitors might respond',
    winningStrategy: 'Recommended strategy to win in this competitive landscape',
  },
})

// Using the defined function
const competitiveAnalysis = await ai.competitiveLandscape({ 
  company: 'Stripe', 
  industry: 'Payment Processing' 
})
```

### Function-Based Definition with Callbacks

For more complex scenarios, you can define functions with callbacks that orchestrate multiple AI function calls:

```typescript
import { AI } from 'functions.do'

export const ai = AI({
  writeBook: async (args, { ai, db, api }) => {
    // Step 1: Create book proposal with provided args
    const proposal = await ai.createBookProposal(args)

    // Step 2: Generate table of contents based on proposal
    const toc = await ai.createTableOfContents({ proposal })

    // Step 3: Create detailed outlines for each chapter
    const chapterOutlines = await Promise.all(
      toc.chapters.map(async (chapter, idx) => {
        return ai.createChapterOutline({
          bookTitle: proposal.title,
          chapterNumber: (idx + 1).toString(),
          chapterTitle: chapter.title,
        })
      }),
    )

    // Additional steps omitted for brevity...

    return {
      proposal,
      tableOfContents: toc,
      chapterOutlines,
      // Other return values...
    }
  },

  // Define the schemas for the functions used in the callback
  createBookProposal: {
    title: 'proposed title of the book',
    subtitle: 'proposed subtitle of the book',
    author: 'name of the author',
    targetAudience: ['primary audience segments for the book'],
    marketAnalysis: 'analysis of the current market for this type of book',
    competitiveBooks: ['list of similar books in the market'],
    uniqueSellingPoints: ['what makes this book different and valuable'],
    keyTakeaways: ['main insights readers will gain'],
    marketingPotential: 'assessment of marketing opportunities',
    coverDescription: 'visual description of the layout and image of the book cover',
    estimatedWordCount: 'approximate word count for the entire book',
    estimatedTimeToComplete: 'timeline for completing the manuscript',
    summary: 'one paragraph summary of the book concept',
  },

  createTableOfContents: {
    bookTitle: 'title of the book',
    introduction: 'brief description of the introduction',
    chapters: [
      {
        title: 'chapter title',
        summary: 'brief summary of the chapter content',
        sections: [
          {
            title: 'section title',
            summary: 'brief description of the section content',
          },
        ],
        estimatedPages: 'estimated number of pages for this chapter',
      },
    ],
    conclusion: 'brief description of the conclusion',
    appendices: ['list of potential appendices if applicable'],
    bibliography: 'description of reference sources if applicable',
    estimatedTotalPages: 'estimated total page count for the book',
  },
})

// Using the defined function
const book = await ai.writeBook({ 
  topic: 'Artificial Intelligence in Business',
  author: 'Jane Smith',
  audience: 'Business executives and technology leaders'
})
```

})
```

## Advanced Configuration

You can override system settings for specific function calls to customize the AI behavior:

```typescript
import { ai } from 'functions.do'

const landingPage = await ai.generateLandingPage(
  {
    brand: 'Functions.do',
    idea: 'AI-powered Functions-as-a-Service',
  },
  {
    headline: 'attention-grabbing headline that clearly states value proposition',
    subheadline: 'supporting statement that adds clarity to the headline',
    productDescription: 'concise explanation of what the product does and its benefits',
    keyFeatures: ['list of main features or benefits'],
    socialProof: ['testimonials, user counts, or other trust indicators'],
    callToAction: 'primary button text and action',
  },
  {
    model: 'anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet:thinking',
    system: 'You are an expert at generating highly-converting marketing copy for startup landing pages',
    temperature: 1.0,
    seed: 1741452228,
  },
)
```

### Model Selection

You can specify different AI models for different tasks based on their capabilities:

```typescript
import { ai } from 'functions.do'

// Use a specific model for research-intensive tasks
const research = await ai.researchCompany(
  { company: 'Tesla' }, 
  {}, 
  { model: 'perplexity/sonar-deep-research' }
)

// Use a different model for creative tasks
const blogPost = await ai.writeBlogPost(
  { topic: 'The Future of AI', tone: 'Optimistic' }, 
  {}, 
  { model: 'anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet:creative' }
)

// Use a model with code capabilities for programming tasks
const code = await ai.generateCode(
  { language: 'TypeScript', task: 'Create a React component for a form' }, 
  {}, 
  { model: 'openai/gpt-4-turbo:code' }
