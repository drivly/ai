# Webhooks

Configure and manage webhooks to receive real-time notifications about events in your AI applications.

## Overview

Webhooks provide a way to receive real-time notifications about events in your AI applications. Webhooks can:

- Notify external systems about events
- Trigger external workflows
- Enable real-time integrations
- Provide event-driven architecture

## Key Features

- **Event Notifications**: Receive notifications about events in your AI applications
- **Customizable Payloads**: Configure the payload format for webhook notifications
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Automatically retry failed webhook deliveries
- **Security**: Secure webhook endpoints with signatures and authentication

## Creating Webhooks

Create webhooks using the Admin.do API:

```typescript
// Create a webhook
const webhook = await admin.webhooks.create({
  name: 'My Webhook',
  description: 'A webhook for my application',
  organization: 'org-123',
  url: 'https://example.com/webhook',
  events: ['function.executed', 'workflow.completed', 'agent.completed'],
  secret: 'my-webhook-secret',
  enabled: true,
})
```

## Managing Webhooks

Manage webhooks using the Admin.do API:

```typescript
// Get all webhooks
const webhooks = await admin.webhooks.list({
  organization: 'org-123',
  limit: 10,
  offset: 0,
})

// Get a specific webhook
const webhook = await admin.webhooks.get('wh-123')

// Update a webhook
const updatedWebhook = await admin.webhooks.update('wh-123', {
  name: 'My Updated Webhook',
  description: 'An updated webhook for my application',
  url: 'https://example.com/updated-webhook',
  events: ['function.executed', 'workflow.completed', 'agent.completed', 'data.created'],
  enabled: true,
})

// Delete a webhook
await admin.webhooks.delete('wh-123')

// Enable a webhook
await admin.webhooks.enable('wh-123')

// Disable a webhook
await admin.webhooks.disable('wh-123')

// Rotate webhook secret
const newSecret = await admin.webhooks.rotateSecret('wh-123')
```

## Webhook Deliveries

View webhook deliveries using the Admin.do API:

```typescript
// Get webhook deliveries
const deliveries = await admin.webhooks.getDeliveries('wh-123', {
  timeRange: {
    start: '2023-06-01T00:00:00Z',
    end: '2023-06-30T23:59:59Z',
  },
  status: 'success',
  limit: 10,
  offset: 0,
})

// Get a specific delivery
const delivery = await admin.webhooks.getDelivery('wh-123', 'del-123')

// Retry a delivery
await admin.webhooks.retryDelivery('wh-123', 'del-123')
```

## Webhook Payload

Webhook payloads include information about the event and the resource that triggered the event:

```json
{
  "id": "evt-123",
  "type": "function.executed",
  "created": "2023-06-15T12:34:56Z",
  "organization": "org-123",
  "project": "proj-123",
  "data": {
    "id": "func-123",
    "name": "My Function",
    "execution": {
      "id": "exec-123",
      "status": "success",
      "startTime": "2023-06-15T12:34:50Z",
      "endTime": "2023-06-15T12:34:56Z",
      "input": {
        "name": "John"
      },
      "output": {
        "greeting": "Hello, John!"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Webhook Security

Secure your webhook endpoints by verifying the webhook signature:

```typescript
// Node.js example
const crypto = require('crypto')
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

app.use(express.json())

app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  const signature = req.headers['x-admin-signature']
  const timestamp = req.headers['x-admin-timestamp']
  const webhookSecret = 'my-webhook-secret'

  // Create the signature
  const payload = timestamp + '.' + JSON.stringify(req.body)
  const expectedSignature = crypto.createHmac('sha256', webhookSecret).update(payload).digest('hex')

  // Verify the signature
  if (signature !== expectedSignature) {
    return res.status(401).send('Invalid signature')
  }

  // Verify the timestamp is recent (within 5 minutes)
  const timestampDate = new Date(parseInt(timestamp))
  const now = new Date()
  const fiveMinutesAgo = new Date(now.getTime() - 5 * 60 * 1000)

  if (timestampDate < fiveMinutesAgo) {
    return res.status(401).send('Timestamp too old')
  }

  // Process the webhook
  const event = req.body
  console.log(`Received event: ${event.type}`)

  // Handle the event based on its type
  switch (event.type) {
    case 'function.executed':
      // Handle function execution
      break
    case 'workflow.completed':
      // Handle workflow completion
      break
    case 'agent.completed':
      // Handle agent completion
      break
    default:
      // Handle unknown event type
      break
  }

  // Acknowledge receipt of the webhook
  res.status(200).send('Webhook received')
})

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Webhook server listening on port 3000')
})
```

## Webhook Testing

Test webhooks using the Admin.do API:

```typescript
// Test a webhook
const testResult = await admin.webhooks.test('wh-123', {
  event: 'function.executed',
  data: {
    id: 'func-123',
    name: 'My Function',
    execution: {
      id: 'exec-123',
      status: 'success',
      startTime: '2023-06-15T12:34:50Z',
      endTime: '2023-06-15T12:34:56Z',
      input: {
        name: 'John',
      },
      output: {
        greeting: 'Hello, John!',
      },
    },
  },
})
```

## Webhook Filters

Filter webhook events using the Admin.do API:

```typescript
// Create a webhook with filters
const webhook = await admin.webhooks.create({
  name: 'My Filtered Webhook',
  description: 'A webhook with filters',
  organization: 'org-123',
  url: 'https://example.com/webhook',
  events: ['function.executed'],
  filters: {
    'function.executed': {
      function: {
        id: ['func-123', 'func-456'],
        name: {
          startsWith: 'My',
        },
      },
      execution: {
        status: ['success'],
      },
    },
  },
  secret: 'my-webhook-secret',
  enabled: true,
})

// Update webhook filters
const updatedWebhook = await admin.webhooks.updateFilters('wh-123', {
  'function.executed': {
    function: {
      id: ['func-123', 'func-456', 'func-789'],
      name: {
        startsWith: 'My',
      },
    },
    execution: {
      status: ['success', 'error'],
    },
  },
})
```
