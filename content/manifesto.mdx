# Business-as-Code

## Economically Valuable Work

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is frequently defined as the capability of a system to perform economically valuable work—tasks that deliver tangible and measurable impact to businesses, societies, and individuals. At the heart of this definition lies a critical realization: intelligence becomes meaningful not when it is merely conversational, but when it drives real-world outcomes and measurable value.

## Moving Beyond Chat

The first wave of powerful AI brought us conversational models capable of impressive dialogues and generative capabilities. Yet, businesses thrive not just on ideas or dialogue, but on decisive, efficient, and scalable actions. AI's true promise emerges when we move beyond chat—beyond language alone—to structured actions, measurable tasks, and coordinated work that tangibly advances the strategic objectives of organizations.

## Functions Without Leaky Abstractions

To harness AI effectively, we require clean, composable primitives—Functions—that encapsulate logic into clear, repeatable units of work. Functions must be reliable and predictable, free from leaky abstractions. They represent deterministic code, generative outputs, agent-driven automation, and even human contributions, each defined by clear inputs and strongly-typed outputs. By encapsulating intelligence into modular and composable units, we eliminate ambiguity and foster clarity, accountability, and predictability at scale.

## Workflows for Reliable Business Processes

Just as industry titans like McDonald's and Walmart have demonstrated the necessity of robust, standardized processes for scaling intelligent human labor, businesses now demand structured workflows to integrate AI effectively. Workflows orchestrate Functions—uniting deterministic automation, generative creativity, autonomous agentic execution, and human ingenuity—into cohesive systems that deliver reliable, repeatable, and scalable outcomes aligned precisely with strategic business goals.

## Agents as Autonomous Digital Workers

Agents are the autonomous digital workforce of the future—intelligent entities driven by explicit goals and measured rigorously against business-defined Key Results. Unlike isolated AI experiments, Agents are productive collaborators embedded in structured Workflows. They interact autonomously, invoking Functions, responding to Events, and continuously optimizing through feedback and evaluations. This integration ensures their autonomy is strategic, aligned, and reliably beneficial.

## Business as Code

The culmination of these primitives—Functions, Workflows, Agents, Evaluations, Experiments, and Observability—is Business as Code. It represents a revolutionary way of operating, where businesses encode their operational models directly into structured, observable, and optimizable code. In this paradigm, strategic goals become explicit Objectives, outcomes become measurable Key Results, and every action, from human tasks to autonomous AI decisions, is executed with precision, transparency, and strategic alignment.

Business as Code is not just the future of software. It is the future of intelligent work itself.
