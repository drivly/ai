# Resources

Resources are specific instances of Nouns in your system - the actual entities that participate in business processes. In English grammar terms, Resources are the concrete instances of nouns that can act as subjects or objects in sentences.

## Overview

In our semantic data model, Resources are the actual entities that exist in your system (like a specific Customer "ACME Corp", a specific Product "Enterprise Plan", or a specific Order "ORD-12345"). They are instances of Noun types and can participate in Actions as either subjects or objects.

The Resources collection provides a way to store, manage, and interact with these entities in your business applications. Resources can be:
- Physical objects (like products, devices, or assets)
- Digital artifacts (like documents, images, or files)
- Abstract concepts (like accounts, permissions, or settings)
- People, organizations, or other entities

## Data Structure

Each Resource document includes:
- **name**: A human-readable identifier
- **sqid**: A short, unique ID for quick reference
- **hash**: A unique hash based on the Resource's content
- **type**: A reference to a Noun that defines what kind of thing this is
- **data**: The actual properties and attributes of this Resource
- **subjectOf**: Actions where this Resource is the Subject
- **objectOf**: Actions where this Resource is the Object

## Usage

You can create, read, update, and delete Resources through the Database API:

```javascript
// Create a new Resource
const product = await db.resources.create({
  name: 'Premium Subscription',
  type: productNoun.id, // Reference to the Product noun
  data: {
    price: 99.99,
    billingCycle: 'monthly',
    features: ['Unlimited access', '24/7 support', 'API integration']
  }
})

// Find Resources by properties
const premiumProducts = await db.resources.find({
  where: {
    'data.price': {
      greater_than: 50
    },
    'data.billingCycle': {
      equals: 'monthly'
    }
  }
})

// Update a Resource
await db.resources.update(product.id, {
  data: {
    price: 89.99,
    features: ['Unlimited access', '24/7 support', 'API integration', 'New feature!']
  }
})

// Delete a Resource
await db.resources.delete(product.id)
```

## Relationships

Resources can be related to other Resources through Actions that follow the Subject-Predicate-Object pattern. For example, a Customer (Subject) can Purchase (Predicate) a Product (Object).

```javascript
// Create an Action that relates two Resources
const purchaseAction = await db.actions.create({
  subject: customer.id, // A Customer Resource
  predicate: purchaseVerb.id, // The Purchase verb
  object: product.id // A Product Resource
})
```

## Resource Categories

Resources in the system can be categorized based on their type (Noun) for better organization and querying.

## Vector Search

Resources support vector search capabilities for semantic search, allowing you to find related Resources based on meaning rather than just keyword matching.

```javascript
// Search for Resources semantically related to a query
const results = await searchResources('renewable energy solutions', 5)
```
