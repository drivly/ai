# Databases

The Databases collection provides configuration options for how your data is stored, accessed, and managed within the platform.

## Overview

The Databases collection allows you to define different database configurations for your applications:

- **Integrated** - Uses the platform's integrated collections
- **Dedicated** - Dedicated database instances in specific AWS regions
- **Self-Hosted** - Self-managed database instances with your own configuration

## Database Types

### Integrated

Integrated databases use the platform's built-in collections system. This is the simplest option and requires no additional configuration.

- **Schema Enforcement**: Can be set to "flexible" (schema-less) or "enforced" (schema validation)
- **Domain**: The domain where the API and Admin portal will be hosted

### Dedicated

Dedicated databases provide isolated database instances managed by the platform. Options include:

- **Database Type**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or SQLite
- **Region**: Choose from popular AWS regions (us-east-1, us-east-2, us-west-1, us-west-2, eu-west-1, etc.)
- **Schema Enforcement**: Can be set to "flexible" (schema-less) or "enforced" (schema validation)
- **Domain**: The domain where the API and Admin portal will be hosted

### Self-Hosted

Self-hosted databases allow you to use your own database infrastructure. Options include:

- **Database Type**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or SQLite
- **Schema Enforcement**: Can be set to "flexible" (schema-less) or "enforced" (schema validation)
- **Domain**: The domain where the API and Admin portal will be hosted

## Relationships

Databases have a many-to-many relationship with Nouns, allowing you to associate specific database configurations with different types of entities in your application.

## Example Configuration

```typescript
import { db } from 'database.do'

// Create a new database configuration
const productionDb = await db.databases.create({
  name: 'Production Database',
  type: 'Dedicated',
  databaseType: 'Postgres',
  region: 'us-east-1',
  schemaEnforcement: 'enforced',
  domain: 'api.example.com',
  nouns: ['products', 'customers', 'orders'],
})

// Query databases with filtering
const dedicatedDatabases = await db.databases.find({
  where: {
    type: 'Dedicated',
    databaseType: 'Postgres',
  },
})
```
