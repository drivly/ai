# Things

Things are specific instances of Nouns in your system - the actual entities that participate in business processes. In English grammar terms, Things are the concrete instances of nouns that can act as subjects or objects in sentences.

## Overview

In our semantic data model, Things are the actual entities that exist in your system (like a specific Customer "ACME Corp", a specific Product "Enterprise Plan", or a specific Order "ORD-12345"). They are instances of Noun types and can participate in Actions as either subjects or objects.

The Things collection provides a way to create, manage, and interact with these specific instances in your business applications. Things can be:

- Used for temporary or ad-hoc data structures
- Shared between different components of your application
- Stored in databases or passed between services
- Extended with custom properties and behaviors

## In the Subject-Predicate-Object Model

In our semantic data model, Things play a crucial role as the actual entities that participate in Actions:

```
[Thing (Subject)] → [Verb (Predicate)] → [Thing (Object)]
```

Things can serve as either:
- The Subject performing an action (e.g., "ACME Corp" in "ACME Corp purchased Enterprise Plan")
- The Object receiving an action (e.g., "Enterprise Plan" in "ACME Corp purchased Enterprise Plan")

```
ACME Corp (Customer Thing) → Purchased → Enterprise Plan (Product Thing)
```

## Key Features

- **Concrete Instances**: Represent actual business entities with real data
- **Flexible Schema**: Things can have dynamic or partial schemas to adapt to business needs
- **Extensible**: Easily add new properties or behaviors as business requirements evolve
- **Interoperable**: Things can be converted to and from other business data formats
- **Traceable**: Maintain visibility and audit trails for business objects

## Defining Things

Things can be defined using the Data.do API or through the dashboard interface.

```typescript
// Example thing definition
const UserPreference = {
  name: 'UserPreference',
  description: 'Represents user preferences for the application',
  schema: {
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
      userId: { type: 'string' },
      theme: { type: 'string', enum: ['light', 'dark', 'system'] },
      notifications: { type: 'boolean' },
      language: { type: 'string' },
      customSettings: {
        type: 'object',
        additionalProperties: true,
      },
    },
    required: ['userId'],
    additionalProperties: true,
  },
  indexes: [{ fields: ['userId'], unique: true }],
}
```

## Using Things

Things can be used throughout your AI applications:

```typescript
// Create a new thing
const preference = await things.create('UserPreference', {
  userId: 'user-123',
  theme: 'dark',
  notifications: true,
  language: 'en-US',
  customSettings: {
    fontSize: 14,
    compactView: true,
  },
})

// Query things
const darkThemeUsers = await things.find('UserPreference', {
  where: { theme: 'dark' },
})

// Update a thing
await things.update('UserPreference', 'pref-456', {
  notifications: false,
  customSettings: {
    fontSize: 16,
  },
})
```
