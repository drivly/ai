# Actions

Actions represent relationships between Things in Subject-Predicate-Object format, creating a semantic triple that captures meaningful business events and connections.

## Overview

In our semantic data model, Actions are the dynamic connections between Things, using Verbs as the connecting element. Every Action follows the natural language pattern of Subject-Predicate-Object:

```
[Subject (Thing)] → [Predicate (Verb)] → [Object (Thing)]
```

The Actions collection provides a way to create, track, and analyze these relationships in your business applications. Actions can be:

- Created when business events occur
- Queried to understand relationships between entities
- Analyzed to gain insights into business processes
- Used to trigger workflows and functions

## In the Subject-Predicate-Object Model

Actions are the core implementation of the Subject-Predicate-Object pattern:

```
Customer (Subject) → Purchased (Predicate) → Product (Object)
```

Real-world examples:
- "ACME Corp purchased Enterprise Plan"
- "Developer deployed Application"
- "System processed Payment"

This simple but powerful model allows you to represent complex business relationships and events in an intuitive, language-based format.

```
ACME Corp (Customer Thing) → Purchased (Verb) → Enterprise Plan (Product Thing)
```

## Key Features

- **Semantic Triples**: Represent business events and relationships in natural language format
- **Event Tracking**: Capture and analyze business events as they occur
- **Relationship Modeling**: Define connections between business entities
- **Process Visibility**: Gain insights into business processes and workflows
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain a complete history of business activities

## Creating Actions

Actions can be created using the Data.do API or through the dashboard interface.

```typescript
// Example action creation
const purchaseAction = await actions.create({
  subject: { id: 'customer-123', type: 'Customer' }, // The Thing performing the action
  verb: 'Purchase',                                  // The Verb representing the action
  object: { id: 'product-456', type: 'Product' },    // The Thing receiving the action
  metadata: {
    timestamp: new Date(),
    amount: 99.99,
    currency: 'USD',
    paymentMethod: 'credit_card'
  }
})
```

## Querying Actions

Actions can be queried to understand relationships and analyze business events:

```typescript
// Find all purchases by a specific customer
const customerPurchases = await actions.find({
  where: {
    subject: { id: 'customer-123' },
    verb: 'Purchase'
  },
  include: ['object', 'metadata']
})

// Find all actions performed on a specific product
const productActions = await actions.find({
  where: {
    object: { id: 'product-456' }
  },
  include: ['subject', 'verb', 'metadata']
})
```
