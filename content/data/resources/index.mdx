## Key Features

- **Object Modeling** - Define and manage the structure and properties of business objects
- **Object Tracking** - Monitor the status, location, and history of objects through their lifecycle
- **Object Relationships** - Define and navigate connections between related objects
- **Object Permissions** - Control who can view, modify, or interact with specific objects
- **Object Versioning** - Track changes to objects over time and maintain history
