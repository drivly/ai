# Data Overview

The Data collection provides a simple yet powerful semantic model for representing your business domain, inspired by basic English grammar concepts that are intuitive and approachable.

## Core Data Model

Our platform is built on four fundamental concepts that work together to create a complete representation of your business domain:

- **[Nouns](/nouns)**: Categories or types of things in your system (like Customer, Product, Order)
- **[Verbs](/verbs)**: Actions that can be performed (like Create, Update, Delete)
- **[Resources](/resources)**: Specific instances of Nouns (a particular Customer, Product, or Order)
- **[Actions](/actions)**: Relationships between Resources in Subject-Predicate-Object format

### Subject-Predicate-Object Pattern

At the heart of our data model is the natural language pattern of Subject-Predicate-Object:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Subject<br/>(Resource)] -->|Predicate<br/>(Verb)| B[Object<br/>(Resource)]
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

For example:
- "Customer purchased Product"
- "Developer deployed Application"
- "Startup acquired Funding"

Every Action in the system connects a Subject (a Resource) with an Object (another Resource) through a Predicate (a Verb), creating a semantic triple that represents a meaningful business event or relationship.

```mermaid
graph TD
    Nouns[Nouns<br/>Categories/Types] -->|defines| Resources[Resources<br/>Instances]
    Verbs[Verbs<br/>Action Types] -->|defines| Predicates[Predicates<br/>in Actions]
    Resources -->|Subject| Actions[Actions<br/>S-P-O Relationships]
    Predicates -->|Predicate| Actions
    Resources -->|Object| Actions
    
    style Nouns fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style Verbs fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style Resources fill:#ff9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style Actions fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style Predicates fill:#99f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

## Business Value

The Data components provide a structured foundation for your business domain, enabling you to:

- Create clear representations of your business entities and their relationships
- Define and manage the actions that can be performed within your business processes
- Model and track both physical and virtual objects that your business interacts with
- Build a comprehensive business domain model that drives your AI applications

## Integration with AI Primitives

Data components integrate seamlessly with other AI primitives:

- Use with **Functions** to transform and process business data
- Incorporate into **Workflows** to automate business processes
- Provide context for **Agents** to make intelligent decisions
- Store and retrieve from **Database** for persistent data management
