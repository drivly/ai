# Data Overview

The Data collection provides powerful frameworks for modeling, managing, and processing business entities, actions, and objects in your AI applications.

## Core Components

- **[Nouns](/nouns)**: Represent and manage entities within your workflows clearly and effectively. Entities include customers, products, locations, resources, and other critical business objects.
- **[Verbs](/verbs)**: Define potential actions within workflows explicitly, enabling dynamic decision-making and process optimization based on business logic and context.
- **[Things](/things)**: Efficiently track, manage, and orchestrate physical and virtual objects in workflows, ensuring visibility, traceability, and operational coherence.

## Business Value

The Data components provide a structured foundation for your business domain, enabling you to:

- Create clear representations of your business entities and their relationships
- Define and manage the actions that can be performed within your business processes
- Model and track both physical and virtual objects that your business interacts with
- Build a comprehensive business domain model that drives your AI applications

## Integration with AI Primitives

Data components integrate seamlessly with other AI primitives:

- Use with **Functions** to transform and process business data
- Incorporate into **Workflows** to automate business processes
- Provide context for **Agents** to make intelligent decisions
- Store and retrieve from **Database** for persistent data management
