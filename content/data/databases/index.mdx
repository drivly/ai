# Databases - Structured Data Management

> **Store, query, and manage data with type safety and performance**

## Overview

Databases provide a robust system for storing, querying, and managing structured data within the .do ecosystem. This framework enables applications to maintain data integrity, ensure type safety, and perform efficient operations on both relational and document-based data models.

## Key Features

- **Type-Safe Schema** - Define data models with complete type safety
- **Query Builder** - Construct complex queries with intuitive syntax
- **Transaction Support** - Ensure data integrity across operations
- **Migration System** - Evolve database schema over time
- **Performance Optimization** - Efficient data access and manipulation

## Core Concepts

### Data Modeling

- Schema Definition
- Type Safety
- Relationships
- Constraints
- Indexing

### Query Operations

- Create and Insert
- Read and Select
