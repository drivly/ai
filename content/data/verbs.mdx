# Verbs

Verbs define actions that can be performed within your system - the dynamic elements that connect and transform your business entities. In English grammar terms, verbs are the "action words" that describe what subjects do to objects.

## Overview

In our semantic data model, Verbs define the types of actions that can connect Things (like Create, Update, Delete, Process, Approve). They serve as the predicates in Subject-Predicate-Object relationships.

The Verbs collection provides a way to define, manage, and execute these actions in your business applications. Verbs can be:

- Used to transform nouns from one state to another
- Triggered by events or user actions
- Composed into workflows
- Executed by agents

## In the Subject-Predicate-Object Model

In our semantic data model, Verbs play a crucial role as the predicates that connect subjects and objects:

```
[Subject (Thing)] → [Predicate (Verb)] → [Object (Thing)]
```

For example, in the action "Customer purchased Product":
- "Customer" is the Subject (a Thing)
- "purchased" is the Predicate (a Verb)
- "Product" is the Object (another Thing)

```
ACME Corp (Customer) → Purchased → Enterprise Plan (Product)
```

## Key Features

- **Action Definitions**: Verbs represent specific business operations that can be performed
- **Process-Oriented**: Define clear actions for business process steps
- **Composable**: Verbs can be combined to create complex business operations
- **Auditable**: Track when and how business actions are executed
- **Permission-Based**: Control who can execute specific business operations

## Defining Verbs

Verbs can be defined using the Data.do API or through the dashboard interface.

```typescript
// Example verb definition
const ProcessOrder = {
  name: 'ProcessOrder',
  description: 'Processes an order from pending to fulfilled state',
  subjects: ['Order'],
  input: z.object({
    orderId: z.string(),
    processingOptions: z
      .object({
        priority: z.enum(['standard', 'express', 'rush']).optional(),
        notifyCustomer: z.boolean().default(true),
      })
      .optional(),
  }),
  output: z.object({
    success: z.boolean(),
    processingTime: z.number(),
    trackingNumber: z.string().optional(),
    notes: z.string().optional(),
  }),
  sideEffects: [
    { type: 'update', subject: 'Order', field: 'status' },
    { type: 'create', subject: 'Shipment' },
    { type: 'notify', subject: 'Customer' },
  ],
  permissions: ['order:process', 'shipment:create'],
}
```

## Using Verbs

Verbs can be executed throughout your AI applications:

```typescript
// Execute a verb
const result = await verbs.execute('ProcessOrder', {
  orderId: 'order-123',
  processingOptions: {
    priority: 'express',
    notifyCustomer: true,
  },
})

// Use in workflows
const orderFulfillmentWorkflow = {
  steps: [
    {
      id: 'validate',
      verb: 'ValidateOrder',
      input: { orderId: '{{input.orderId}}' },
    },
    {
      id: 'process',
      verb: 'ProcessOrder',
      input: {
        orderId: '{{input.orderId}}',
        processingOptions: {
          priority: '{{input.priority}}',
        },
      },
      condition: '{{validate.isValid}}',
    },
    {
      id: 'ship',
      verb: 'ShipOrder',
      input: {
        orderId: '{{input.orderId}}',
        trackingInfo: '{{process.trackingNumber}}',
      },
    },
  ],
}
```
