# Business-as-Code

To do [Business-as-Code](/docs/manifesto), all work is requested and delivered by a [Function](/docs/functions) using the [API](/docs/apis/functions.do) or [SDK](/docs/sdks/functions.do). [Workflows](/docs/workflows), [Agents](/docs/agents), and [APIs](/docs/apis) are the core primitives of the platform.

## Workflows

A [Workflow](/docs/workflows) is a special type of [Function](/docs/functions) defined as declarative [Code](/docs/functions/code) that enables [Generative](/docs/functions/generative) [AI](/docs/functions/ai) and [Humans](/docs/functions/humans) to work together to accomplish business [Tasks](/docs/business/tasks) in the pursuit of a [Goal](/docs/business/goals) as measured by [KPIs](/docs/business/kpis).


## Functions

A [Functions](/docs/functions) that accept inputs and return outputs: [Code](/docs/functions/code), [Generative](/docs/functions/generative), [Agent](/docs/functions/agent), and [Human](/docs/functions/human). 

{/* ### Code Function */}

 A [Code Function](/docs/functions/code) is a deterministic function with objective results, making it ideal for anything that has traditionally been capable of being automated with classical computing. It is [evaluated](/docs/evals) using traditional unit tests.

{/* ### Generative Function */}

 A [Generative Function](/docs/functions/generative) is a non-deterministic function that uses AI to generate content or structured data, and may have either objective or subjective results.  [Objective](/docs/functions/generative#objective) functions are evaluated using traditional unit tests, while [Subjective](/docs/functions/generative#subjective) functions are evaluated using [LLM-as-Judge](/docs/experiments/evals#llm-as-judge), [Human Feedback](/docs/functions/human), or trailing [Business KPIs](/docs/business/kpis).
 
{/* ### Agent Function */}

 An [Agent Function](/docs/functions/agent) uses autonomous AI agents to perform tasks.
 
{/* ### Human Function */}

 A [Human Function](/docs/functions/human) uses human workers to perform [Tasks](/docs/business/tasks) in prioritized [Queues](/docs/business/queues).

## Agents

An [Agent](/docs/agents) is an autonomous digital worker with [Goals & Objectives](/docs/business/goals) and is evaluated by the [Key Results](/docs/business/kpis) delivered to the business.
