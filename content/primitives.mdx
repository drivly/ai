# Business-as-Code

To do [Business-as-Code](/docs/manifesto), all work is requested and delivered through [Functions](/docs/functions), with [Workflows](/docs/workflows), [Agents](/docs/agents), and [APIs](/docs/apis) as the core primitives of the platform.

## Workflows

A [Workflow](/docs/workflows) is a special type of [Function](/docs/functions) defined as declarative [Code](/docs/functions/code) that enables [generative](/docs/functions/generative) [AI](/docs/functions/ai) and [Humans](/docs/functions/humans) to work together to accomplish business [tasks](/docs/business/tasks).
