# Business-as-Code

To do [Business-as-Code](/docs/manifesto), all work is requested and delivered through [Functions](/docs/functions), with [Workflows](/docs/workflows), [Agents](/docs/agents), and [APIs](/docs/apis) as the core primitives of the platform.

## Workflows

A [Workflow](/docs/workflows) is a special type of [Function](/docs/functions) defined as declarative [Code](/docs/functions/code) that enables [Generative](/docs/functions/generative) [AI](/docs/functions/ai) and [Humans](/docs/functions/humans) to work together to accomplish business [Tasks](/docs/business/tasks) in the pursuit of a [Goal](/docs/business/goals) as measured by [KPIs](/docs/business/kpis).


## Functions

There are four types of [Functions](/docs/functions) that accept inputs and return outputs: [Code](/docs/functions/code), [Generative](/docs/functions/generative), [Agent](/docs/functions/agent), and [Human](/docs/functions/human). 

 A [Code Function](/docs/functions/code) is a deterministic function with objective results, making it ideal for anything that has traditionally been capable of being automated with classical computing. It is [evaluated](/docs/evals) using traditional unit tests.

 A [Generative Function](/docs/functions/generative) is a non-deterministic function that uses AI to generate content or structured data, and may have either objective or subjective results.  [Objective Generative Functions](/docs/functions/generative#objective) are evaluated 
 
 An [Agent Function](/docs/functions/agent) uses autonomous AI agents to perform tasks.
 
 A [Human Function](/docs/functions/human) uses human workers to perform [Tasks](/docs/business/tasks) in prioritized [Queues](/docs/business/queues).

## Agents

An [AI Agent](/docs/agents) is an autonomous digital worker
