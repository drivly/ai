# [Triggers.do](https://triggers.do) - Event-Driven Workflow Initiation

> Initiate workflows based on events from various sources

## Overview

Triggers.do provides a framework for defining and handling events that initiate workflows. This event-driven system allows your AI applications to respond to:

- Webhook events from external systems
- Scheduled time-based events
- User actions and interactions
- System state changes
- Data changes and updates

## Features

- **Multiple Trigger Types**: Webhooks, schedules, database changes, and more
- **Event Filtering**: Process only relevant events based on conditions
- **Data Transformation**: Shape event data before passing to workflows
- **Reliable Delivery**: Ensure events are processed even during outages
- **Debugging Tools**: Trace and replay events for troubleshooting

## Usage

```typescript
import { defineTrigger } from 'triggers.do'

// Define a webhook trigger for new orders
const newOrderTrigger = defineTrigger({
  name: 'newOrder',
  type: 'webhook',
  description: 'Triggers when a new order is created',

  // Define the endpoint configuration
  endpoint: {
    path: '/webhooks/new-order',
    method: 'POST',
    auth: { type: 'api-key', headerName: 'X-API-Key' },
  },

  // Define the payload schema
  schema: {
    orderId: { type: 'string', required: true },
    customerId: { type: 'string', required: true },
    items: { type: 'array' },
    totalAmount: { type: 'number', required: true },
  },

  // Connect to the target workflow
  target: 'processNewOrder',
})
```
