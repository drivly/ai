  import { createFunction } from 'functions.do';

  const getUser = createFunction({
    name: 'getUser',
    input: z.object({

      name: z.string(),
      email: z.string().email(),
    }),

faqs:
  - question: "How does Functions.do ensure type safety across environments?"
    answer: "Functions.do generates TypeScript interfaces from your function definitions that are used both at runtime and build time, ensuring consistent types across your entire stack."
  
  - question: "Can I use Functions.do with my existing infrastructure?"
    answer: "Yes, Functions.do is designed to be infrastructure-agnostic. You can deploy your functions to AWS Lambda, Vercel Functions, Cloudflare Workers, or any other serverless platform."
  
  - question: "How does Functions.do handle versioning and breaking changes?"
    answer: "Functions.do includes built-in versioning capabilities that allow you to evolve your API without breaking existing clients. You can deprecate older versions gradually while maintaining backward compatibility."
