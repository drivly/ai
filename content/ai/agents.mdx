# Agents

Agents are autonomous digital workers that can perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with other systems.

## Overview

Agents.do provides a platform for creating, managing, and deploying autonomous agents that can:

- Execute complex tasks with minimal human intervention
- Make decisions based on predefined rules or AI models
- Interact with external systems and APIs
- Collaborate with other agents to solve problems

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Operation**: Agents can work independently to achieve goals
- **Decision Making**: Built-in decision-making capabilities using rules or AI
- **System Integration**: Connect to external systems and APIs
- **Collaboration**: Agents can work together in teams

## Creating Agents

Agents can be created using the Agents.do API or through the dashboard interface.

```typescript
// Example agent definition
const customerSupportAgent = {
  name: 'customerSupportAgent',
  description: 'Handles customer support inquiries and routes them to the appropriate department',
  capabilities: ['respondToBasicQuestions', 'classifyInquiries', 'routeToHumanAgent', 'searchKnowledgeBase'],
  knowledgeSources: [
    { type: 'vector-db', id: 'support-documentation' },
    { type: 'api', id: 'ticket-system' },
  ],
  decisionModel: {
    type: 'llm',
    model: 'gpt-4',
    promptTemplate: 'supportAgentPrompt',
  },
  workflows: [
    { id: 'initialResponse', trigger: 'newInquiry' },
    { id: 'escalationProcess', trigger: 'complexInquiry' },
  ],
}
```

## Agent Execution

Agents can be deployed and managed through the Agents.do platform:

```typescript
// Deploy an agent
const deployedAgent = await agents.deploy('customerSupportAgent', {
  environment: 'production',
  replicas: 3,
})

// Interact with an agent
const response = await agents.interact('customerSupportAgent', {
  message: 'I need help with my recent order',
  context: { orderId: '12345', customer: { id: '789', tier: 'premium' } },
})
```
