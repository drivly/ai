# Agents

Agents are autonomous digital workers that handle complex tasks independently, scaling productivity through AI-driven workflows. Agents continuously learn, adapt, and self-optimize to meet evolving business needs.

## Overview

Agents.do provides a platform for deploying autonomous agents that handle complex tasks independently, scaling productivity through AI-driven workflows. Agents can:

- Execute complex tasks with minimal human intervention
- Make decisions based on predefined rules or AI models
- Interact with external systems and APIs
- Collaborate with other agents to solve problems

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Operation**: Agents work independently to achieve business goals
- **Continuous Learning**: Agents adapt and improve through experience
- **Self-Optimization**: Agents refine their processes for better outcomes
- **Business Integration**: Seamlessly connect to business systems and workflows
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Agents coordinate across departments and systems

## Creating Business Agents

Agents can be created using the Agents.do API or through the dashboard interface to automate complex business processes.

```typescript
// Example business agent definition
const salesDevelopmentAgent = {
  name: 'salesDevelopmentAgent',
  description: 'Autonomously qualifies leads, conducts initial outreach, and schedules meetings with sales representatives',
  capabilities: [
    'leadQualification', 
    'personalization', 
    'outreachSequencing', 
    'meetingScheduling', 
    'crm-integration'
  ],
  knowledgeSources: [
    { type: 'vector-db', id: 'company-knowledge-base' },
    { type: 'api', id: 'crm-system' },
    { type: 'api', id: 'calendar-system' },
    { type: 'api', id: 'email-platform' },
  ],
  decisionModel: {
    type: 'llm',
    model: 'gpt-4',
    promptTemplate: 'salesDevelopmentPrompt',
    contextWindow: 16000,
  },
  workflows: [
    { id: 'leadQualification', trigger: 'newLead' },
    { id: 'initialOutreach', trigger: 'qualifiedLead' },
    { id: 'followUpSequence', trigger: 'noResponse', maxAttempts: 5 },
    { id: 'meetingScheduling', trigger: 'positiveResponse' },
  ],
  learningCapabilities: {
    feedbackSources: ['salesReps', 'meetings', 'responses'],
    optimizationMetrics: ['qualificationAccuracy', 'responseRate', 'meetingConversionRate'],
    adaptationFrequency: 'weekly',
  },
}
```

## Business Agent Deployment

Agents can be deployed and managed through the Agents.do platform to automate critical business processes:

```typescript
// Deploy a business agent with monitoring and analytics
const deployedAgent = await agents.deploy('salesDevelopmentAgent', {
  environment: 'production',
  replicas: 5,
  monitoring: {
    metrics: ['leadQualityScore', 'responseRate', 'meetingConversionRate'],
    alertThresholds: {
      leadQualityScore: { min: 0.7 },
      responseRate: { min: 0.15 },
    },
  },
  analytics: {
    dashboards: ['salesPerformance', 'outreachEffectiveness'],
    reportingFrequency: 'daily',
  },
})

// Interact with a business agent
const response = await agents.interact('salesDevelopmentAgent', {
  action: 'qualifyLead',
  data: { 
    company: 'Acme Corporation',
    contactName: 'Jane Smith',
    contactTitle: 'VP of Operations',
    industry: 'Manufacturing',
    employeeCount: 500,
    annualRevenue: '$50M',
    recentEvents: ['Expanded to European market', 'Launched new product line'],
  },
  businessContext: { 
    salesTarget: 'Enterprise SaaS solution',
    currentQuarterFocus: 'Manufacturing sector expansion',
    successMetrics: ['Implementation timeline', 'ROI within 6 months'],
  },
})
```
