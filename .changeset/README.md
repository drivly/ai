# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## Versioning Strategy

This repository uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for managing versions and publishing packages.

- Packages in the `sdks` folder are versioned together. When one SDK needs a version update, all SDKs get the same version.
- Packages in the `pkgs` folder are versioned independently based on changes.

### Adding a changeset

To add a changeset, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will guide you through the process of creating a changeset file that describes your changes.
