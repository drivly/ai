# AI Primitives Platform Overview

This rule provides context about the AI Primitives platform, its strategic vision, and core components.

## Applies to
**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,mdx}

## Rule
The AI Primitives platform provides composable building blocks that enable developers to create, deploy, and manage AI applications with minimal complexity while maintaining reliability and scalability. The platform emphasizes:

1. **Economically valuable work** delivered through simple APIs
2. **Practical applications** of AI that deliver measurable business value
3. **Composable architecture** with Functions, Workflows, and Agents as core primitives
4. **Enterprise-grade reliability** with comprehensive testing and evaluation

### Core Primitives
- **Functions.do**: Strongly-typed composable building blocks
- **Workflows.do**: Declarative state machines for orchestration
- **Agents.do**: Autonomous digital workers
- **LLM.do**: Intelligent AI gateway for routing requests to optimal models
- **Database.do**: Persistent data storage with Payload CMS
- **APIs.do**: Unified API gateway for all services
