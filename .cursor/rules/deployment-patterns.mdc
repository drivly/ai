# Deployment Patterns

This rule defines the deployment patterns and build configuration for the AI Primitives platform.

## Applies to
**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,json,mjs}

## Rule
### Deployment Patterns
- Vercel is used for deployment and preview environments
- Preview environments follow the URL pattern: https://ai-git-{branch-name}.dev.driv.ly/
- The Velite content build step (build:content) must be integrated into the Vercel build process
- Keep next.config.mjs minimal with only essential configurations
- Avoid using node: imports in package files, particularly in ai-models

### Build Configuration Principles
- Use Turborepo for managing the build order in monorepo packages
- Use Turbopack for Next.js applications, making transpilePackages configuration unnecessary
- Keep next.config.mjs minimal with only essential configurations
- Avoid complex webpack configurations entirely
- Tests should be excluded from the build process
- Nextra v4 configuration is primarily managed in app/(docs)/docs/layout.tsx
