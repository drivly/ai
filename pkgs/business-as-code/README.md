# business-as-code

> Build, define, launch, experiment, iterate, and grow your business entirely in code.

## Overview

Business-as-Code represents a revolutionary approach to defining, operating, and scaling businesses. It moves beyond traditional methods by enabling the entire business lifecycle—from initial concept and strategy to execution and iteration—to be managed through clean, structured, and executable code.

This paradigm builds upon core primitives like Functions, Workflows, and Agents, allowing complex business logic, processes, and even autonomous operations to be codified. By treating the business itself as a software system, we unlock unprecedented levels of agility, transparency, experimentation, and optimization.

Drawing inspiration from the principles outlined in the [Manifesto](/docs/manifesto) and leveraging the foundational [Primitives](/docs/primitives) of the [.do](https://dotdo.ai) ecosystem, `business-as-code` provides the framework to transform strategic objectives into measurable outcomes through code.
