/*
* Tricks AI SDK into giving us the body in a format that we can use.
* The reason why we need to do this is because all getArgs functions are private,
* so we can't use them to get the body.
* 
* We need the body to send to OpenRouter but I didnt want to have to do all of the same work that the OpenAI provider does.
* This is 100% a hack, but it works, and has virtually no performance impact.
