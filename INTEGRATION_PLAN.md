# Integration Plan: Merging exec-symbols into the .do Platform

This document outlines a plan for integrating the `exec-symbols` functional programming library with the `drivly/ai` platform, with a specific focus on understanding the integration points and creating a strategy for seamless architectural convergence.

## Executive Summary

The `.do` platform and `exec-symbols` library have been developed in isolation but show remarkable architectural alignment. This integration plan aims to leverage `exec-symbols`' powerful functional programming foundation to enhance the `.do` platform's semantic data model, event tracking, and state machine capabilities.

## Current State Assessment

### drivly/ai Repository

- Uses Payload CMS for collection management
- Has a sophisticated function execution system with support for different output formats
- Provides SDKs for APIs.do, Functions.do, Workflows.do, etc.
- Uses a monorepo structure with pnpm workspaces

### exec-symbols Repository

- Provides a functional programming foundation with Church-encoded primitives
- Implements mock versions of all .do platform services in bridge.ts
- Has a comprehensive adapter mechanism for tracking service calls symbolically
- Uses minimal dependencies and is purely functional
