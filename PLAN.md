## Resource Allocation Strategy

As a project manager, I would recommend the following resource allocation strategy for implementing the AI Primitives platform:

### Team Structure

1. **Core Platform Team**
   - Focus: Functions.do, LLM.do, APIs.do
   - Skills: TypeScript, API design, AI model integration
   - Priority: Phase 1 implementation

2. **Event System Team**
   - Focus: Workflows.do, Triggers.do, Actions.do, Searches.do
   - Skills: Event-driven architecture, state machines, TypeScript
   - Priority: Phase 2 implementation

3. **Agent & Integration Team**
   - Focus: Agents.do, Integrations.do, Database.do
   - Skills: Autonomous systems, API integrations, database design
   - Priority: Phase 2-3 implementation

4. **Documentation & DevOps Team**
   - Focus: Documentation, website, infrastructure, testing
   - Skills: Technical writing, frontend development, DevOps
   - Priority: Continuous throughout all phases

### Implementation Sequence

1. **Start with Core Foundation (Phase 1)**
   - Begin with Functions.do and LLM.do in parallel
   - Follow with APIs.do implementation
   - Establish basic documentation structure early

2. **Build Event System (Phase 2)**
   - Implement Workflows.do building on Functions.do
   - Develop Triggers.do and Actions.do in parallel
   - Add Searches.do capabilities

3. **Expand to Advanced Features (Phase 3)**
   - Implement Agents.do leveraging Functions.do and Workflows.do
   - Enhance Integrations.do capabilities
   - Develop Evals.do framework

4. **Optimize and Scale (Phase 4)**
   - Implement analytics integration
   - Optimize performance
   - Extend model support
   - Add enterprise features

### Critical Path Management

The critical path for this project runs through:
1. Functions.do implementation (core foundation)
2. Workflows.do implementation (building on Functions.do)
3. Event System integration (Triggers, Actions, Searches)
4. Agents.do implementation (leveraging all previous components)

To ensure timely delivery, the project manager should:
1. Allocate additional resources to critical path tasks
2. Monitor progress closely on these components
3. Address blockers immediately
4. Consider parallel implementation where dependencies allow

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Technical Risks**
   - Begin with proof-of-concepts for complex components
   - Implement comprehensive testing early
   - Establish clear API contracts between components

2. **Resource Risks**
   - Cross-train team members on adjacent components
   - Document architecture decisions and implementation details
   - Create reusable patterns and libraries

3. **Timeline Risks**
   - Focus on MVP functionality first
   - Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
   - Establish clear prioritization criteria
