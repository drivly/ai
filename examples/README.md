## Implementation Guide

Each workflow example can be fully automated using the AI Primitives platform by:

1. Importing the `AI` function from `workflows.do`
2. Defining event handlers that trigger workflow execution
3. Utilizing AI, API, and database capabilities within the workflow

For example, an automated customer onboarding workflow:

```typescript
import { AI } from 'workflows.do'

export default AI({
  customerOnboardingWorkflow: async (event, { ai, api, db }) => {
    // 1. Extract customer data from signup event
    const { customer } = event

    // 2. Analyze customer needs and preferences
    const customerProfile = await ai.analyzeCustomerProfile(customer)

    // 3. Generate personalized onboarding materials
    const onboardingMaterials = await ai.generateOnboardingMaterials(customerProfile)

    // 4. Store customer profile in database
    await db.customers.create({
      data: {
        ...customer,
        profileAnalysis: customerProfile,
        onboardingStatus: 'materials_generated',
      },
    })

    // 5. Trigger email sequence
    await api.email.sendOnboardingSequence(customer.email, onboardingMaterials)

    // 6. Schedule follow-up tasks
    return {
      customer,
      onboardingMaterials,
      nextSteps: [
        { task: 'follow_up_call', scheduledFor: '+3days' },
        { task: 'feature_adoption_check', scheduledFor: '+7days' },
      ],
    }
  },

  // Function schemas
  analyzeCustomerProfile: {
    description: 'Analyze customer data to identify needs, preferences, and success factors',
    // Schema definition
  },

  generateOnboardingMaterials: {
    description: 'Create personalized onboarding content based on customer profile',
    // Schema definition
  },
})
```

This approach enables fully automated, end-to-end workflows that can operate without human intervention, making it ideal for digital-only businesses where every process can be automated with AI.
