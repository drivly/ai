## How to Use These Examples

Each workflow example can be implemented using the AI Primitives platform by:

1. Importing the `AI` function from `workflows.do`
2. Defining event handlers and function schemas
3. Utilizing AI, API, and database capabilities within the workflow

For example:

```typescript
import { AI } from 'workflows.do'

export default AI({
  customerOnboardingWorkflow: async (event, { ai, api, db }) => {
    // Workflow implementation
  },
  
  // Function schemas
  analyzeCustomerNeeds: {
    // Schema definition
  }
})
```

Refer to the [workflows.do documentation](https://github.com/drivly/ai/tree/main/sdks/workflows.do) for detailed implementation guidance.
