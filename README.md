In the same way the cloud era was defined by the rise of Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), we believe the AI era will be defined by the rise of Business-as-Code (Bac).  While currently used mostly as chatbots, today's large language models are effectively superhuman at many tasks, with reinforcement learning and test time compute capable providing an accelerating trajectory of progress. Math and Coding are widely viewed
as areas for upcoming expontial improvement, as they can be objectively evaluated and improved.  Business though, especially business processes
that are executed as code, can absolutely have deterministic results, as KPIs and metrics can be objectively measured and improved over time
through iterative experimentation.
