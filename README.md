# Workflows.do / Business-as-Code (BaC)

In the same way the cloud era was defined by Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), the AI era will be characterized by Business-as-Code (BaC). While currently used mostly for chatbots and conversational interfaces, today's large language models (LLMs) are already performing superhuman-level tasks across numerous domains. Reinforcement learning and test-time computation are rapidly accelerating the capabilities of these models. Areas such as mathematics and software development are on the verge of exponential growth, given their ability to be objectively evaluated and improved.

Business processes, when executed as code, also produce deterministic outcomes. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics become objectively measurable, enabling continuous improvement through iterative experimentation and optimization.

## functions.do / Inputs to Reliable Outputs

### code.functions.do / Classical Computation
